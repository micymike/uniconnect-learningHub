# /src/components/ui

This folder is used for reusable UI primitives and components, following the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) conventions.

**Why use this folder?**
- Keeps UI components organized and easy to find.
- Separates UI primitives from feature-specific or page-specific components.
- Improves maintainability and scalability of your codebase.
- Aligns with industry best practices for modern React projects.

Place all reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, backgrounds) here.
